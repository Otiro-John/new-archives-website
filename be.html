<h1>William Beaumont</h1>
<h2>Studies the Stomach</h2>
<p>William Beaumont was a surgeon in the United States army when he became very well known because of a 
series of careful investigations concerning the nature of digestion.It came about in this way.Dr.Beaumont 
had a patient by the name of Alexis St. Martin, a French Canadian by birth.In 1822 St. Martin recieved 
a gunshot wound in the abdomen.Although he recoverd, the wound never completely healed.The bullet had perforated 
the wall of the stomach, leaving a permanent opening through the abdominal wall.It was necessary for him to wear a 
compress over the permanent gastric fistula or opening.He became known as "the man with a lid on his stomach."
Dr. Beaumont, with true scientific curiosity, began to observe the movements of his patient's stomach.
Passing a flexible tube through the opening into the stomach , Beaumont was able to draw fluid at will.
He watched the results of digestion in all its phases, measuring the amount and quality of the gastric juices under
all kinds of conditions,including hunger,pain,frustration,anger,joy,sorrow,and contentment.He noted the colour of 
the stomach wall when patient was under emotional strain and when he was at rest.After several years the patient 
grew tired of all these experiments.He wanted to live like other men, free from scientific observations.
He fled for a time, but was finally brought back for further army service.Dr. Beaumont then had the patient 
assigned to his own servise in the army, so that he could observe him at all times.Although the patient did not 
always appreciate this constant observation, these experiments did clear up many questions concerning digestion 
that had not heretofore been settled.Dr Beaumont is regarded as one of the founders of  the science of 
physiology, thanks to his own keen observations and the unwilling co-operation of his famous patient.
