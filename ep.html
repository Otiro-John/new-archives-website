<h1>Ephraim McDowell</h1>
<h2>Performed first successful Abdominal Operation</h2>
<p>In these days when major sugeries is so common, it is hard to realize that 150 years ago many 
people were dying from simple conditions that are easily handled today.Back in those days there were no 
anesthetics, and no clean , modern hospitals.No one had ever heard of appendicitis, although thousands were 
dying from what they then called "inflammation of the bowels."Men who were wounded in battle often had 
their arms or legs amputated without anything to ease the pain.Doctors knew nothing about germs,and when 
operations were performed they were likely to do more harm than good.Surgeons did not bother to scrub 
their hands before surgery.Often they used instrunments that were contaminated, and no one took the trouble 
to sterilize them.There were no antibiotics to control serious infections, and no trained nurses to care for the 
sick.Hospitals were largely places where poor people went to die!But scientific truth was slowly beginning to 
dawn.Gradually there arose the conviction that human life need not be uselessly thrown away.Around the year 
1800 a young man by the name of Ephraim McDowell left is frontier village in what was then the "far west" 
(Kentucky) and healed for Edinburgh, to be trained as a doctor.That was city the foremost medical and surgical 
center in the world at the time.After obtaining his degree in medicine, he returned to Kentucky  to share 
the rough life of a real pioneer at the very fringe of western civilization.In Edinburgh McDowell had 
heard that operations on abdominal organs might one day be possible, provided the doctor uderstood 
anatomy well and had the skill and knowledge to attempt such a difficult and dangerous operation.Back in 
Kentucky there were those who had called themselves "doctors" who had never had a day of real medical training 
in their whole lives.At least young Dr. McDowell had the benefit of the best the world had to offer at that time.
In 1809 Dr.McDowell was called to diagnose the case of Jane Todd Crawford.Her family was sure she was pregnant,
but when no baby arrived  they were perplexed.After  a creful examination the doctor concluded that she 
had a large ovarian tumor.He told her that she would continue to grow worse.She asked if anyhting could be done.
He replied that sursery was the only answer, but the complete operation had never been successfully performed 
before.Every other operation had failed and all the women had died.With typical pioneer Mrs.Crawford not only 
urged him to operate, but rode horseback sixty miles over rough trails to the little town of Daville 
where the doctor lived.Much to the consternation of the towns people, preparations were made for surgery the 
following Sunday.Everyone was sure the patient would die, but the doctor went ahead with the operation, 
using what meager facilities he had at his disposal.During the church services references were made to 
the wickedness of doctors who attempted surgery, when everyone knew the case was hopeless.At the 
conclusion a hostile crowd gathered round the doctor's house, ready to hang him on the nearest tree after the patient 
died!But as they litsened, they heard sounds of singing coming from inside the house.Mrs. Crawford had a fine 
voice and she was using it with great effect.While the operation was going on she was lying there on the table 
singing solos from Handel's Messaih!She must have been a hardy soul.The doctor had no anesthetic, and was using 
only the crudest of instrunments.She felt every prick of the needle and every cut of the knife.But she kept right on 
singing, calming the angry crowd with her courage.The operation was a complete success, an amizing feat 
considering the crude conditions and the lack of properly trained help.A wonderful new era in medicine 
had dawned at last.Dr.McDowell had demonstrated that abdominal surgery was possible.Another thirty years 
still had to pass before chloroform or ether was available as the first general anesthetics.McDowell and those
who followed him all had thier failures, but a step forward had been taken, and all humanity 
benefited from this simple beginning.At last surgeons could operate inside the abdomen.Thousands of abdominal 
operations are now being performed every day.Expert anesthetists are there to care for the patient at every stage 
of surgery.Highly trained nurses have everything in readiness to provide the professional help so necessary for 
success.All kinds of wonderful instrunments are now available, and there are many refinements and skillful 
techniques that make surgery safer and more predictable in its effects.But all these advances in modern 
surgery only serve to emphasize the importance of that first operation and the greatness of McDowell's contribution 
to the welfare of the whole human family.
