<h1>Dr.Laennec</h1>
<h2>Develops the Stethoscope</h2>
<p>It is suprising how many medical discoveries have been been made almost by accident. 
The stethoscope is a very simple insrunment, used by every practicing physician.It is nothing more than 
a hollow tube with ear pieces at one end and a bell or diaphragm at the other end.Yet his 
remarkable piece of tubing  probably tell us more about the heart and lungs than any other instrunment.
But it was dreamed of until a young French doctor was called to examine the chest of a very bashful young 
lady who was probably suffering from rheumatic heart disease.In those days, if doctors ever litsened to 
their patients' hearts at all, they had to lay their ears down on the patient's chest.This was not always 
appreciated by either doctor or patient.Consequently doctors knew very little about the actions of the heart 
or the diseases affecting the lungs.As Dr. Laennec was hurrying along to the bedside of his patient, he 
happened to notice two boys playing on a pile of plumber.One had his ear to the end of a long plank, the other 
was gently tapping at the other end.They were evidently using some type of code to transmit messages.
The gentle tapping could easily be heard through the wood but not through the air.Suddenly Laennec realized 
he had found away to examine the chest of his bashful patient.Arriving at the house, he asked for a sheet of 
paper.This he rolled up the tube or cylinder, placing one end to his ear and the other end to the chest of 
the patient.To his greate surprise he found he could hear the sounds of the heart far more clearly than ever 
before.He became an expert in the use of the stethoscope, designing several different types of instrunments 
for examining the chest.Another of Laennec's major contributions included a better understanding of tuberculosis, 
one of the greatest killers of all time.Unfortunately he himself died from tuberculosis at the early age of forty 
five.His brilliant life was all too short.But doctors are forever grateful for his discovery of the 
stethoscope, the most useful instrunment in the diagnosis of heart disease today.
