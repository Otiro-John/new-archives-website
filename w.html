<h1>Walter Reed</h1>
<h2>Fighting Yellow Fever</h2>
<p>For more than 200 years yellow fever had scourged the North and South American continents and the 
islands of the Caribbean.No one knew the true cause of the disease, nor how it was transmitted.People blamed 
contaminated clothing ,dishes,bad air, and all kinds of things, often without any reason.Hence it
was difficult to study the disease or to combat it.Most cases of yellow fever occurred in the tropics.In 
the more temperate zones the disease was seen only during the hotter months of the year.As soon as 
the frosts came,the disease disappeared.In the tropics, yellow fever occurred all through the year.One 
day the victims were apparently healthy and strong.Then next they ran a fever, developed a splitting headache 
, and felt aching pains in all their muscles.Next, their skin turned yellow, and they were actually ill for 
days.The milder cases usually recovered;those were more seriously ill died in agony.It was around the 
turn of the century,during the Spanish-American war, that things came to a head.Thousands of American boys 
were in Cuba, helping to free that Country from the tyranny of those times.But many more young men were falling 
before the blows of this secret enemy than from bullets on the field of battle.Major Walter Reed, an American 
bacteriologist, was sent to investigate the cause of this strange malady.With him went several other doctors, 
all determined to find the answer, or die in the attempt.Where were they to start their search?The matter 
was urgent.Right before their eyes orderlines were carrying young men feet first from the hospital wards to 
the burial grounds.The research teams tested every possible cause, and tracked down all the hearsay evidence from 
old-timers, but never a clue could they find.At last in desperation Dr. Reed was willing to consider the possibilty 
of mosquitoes being the cause.This had long been the contention of an old Cuban doctor,Carlos Finlay, but he had 
no proof,only an idea.But any idea was worth trying under such desperate circumstances.So the search 
went on.Vrious types of mosquitoes were caught in the sickrooms and wards where soldiers were dying of yellow 
fever.These were carried to volunteers who were willing to allow themselves to be bitten.All the volunteers came down 
with yellow fever.Most of them fortunately managedto survive.But the risk was enormous, and they all knew it.
Still the skeptics doubted that mosquitoes that mosquitoes were culprits.Major Reed decided to doubly sure.
Other volunteers came forward.Some of these men were willing to sleep in the filthy bedclothes of those who 
had just died from the disease.At the same time all mosquitoes were carefully excluded from the rooms where these 
tests were being made.None of these volunteers came down with the disease.Then to make even more sure, the deadly,
virus-laden mosquitoes were brought in and allowed to bite the men.All of them came down with yellow fever, thus proving that it was 
not contact with contaminated clothing, but rather the mosquitoes that were sreading the disease.Not all 
the volunteers escaped.In this painting Dean Cornwell shows Dr. Lazear allowing an infected mosquito to 
bite Dr. Carroll.He developed the disease but recovered.Unfortunately Dr. Lazear himself was not so fortunate.
He died four weeks later from yellow fever following the accidental bite of an infected mosquito.Other 
volunteers are shown in the picture,mainly in uniform.The white-haired gentleman on the left is doctor Carlos 
Finlay, who insisted that mosquitoes were the cause of this extremely serious menace.United States Army 
engineers quickly cleared the breeding places of these particular yellow-fever-carrying mosquitoes.Other 
countries followed their example,and soon the disease more or less disappeared from the civilized world.But 
we can never forget those who died and those who were willing to die that their fellow men might live.
