<h1>Sir William  Osler</h1>
<h2>A Great Teacher of Medicine</h2>
<p>Among the many many famous teachers of medicine in modern times, none holds a higher place than Dr. William 
Osler.It was he who first introduced bedside teaching for students, demonstrating the disease discussed 
in the textbooks of that day.This was an entirely new departure and one that was looked upon with grave 
misgivings at first.Osler was an intensely pragmatic man.He was widely read in all the classics,and he was 
an authority in the field of medical history.He was an inspiring speaker and a philosopher in the fields 
of medicine and human relations.He was born in Canada, and took his medical degree at McGill University, afterwards 
studying in London, Leipsig, and Vienna.Returning to McGill, he became Professor of Medicine for ten years.
He was then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where he held the same position for five years.
From Philadelphia he later went to Johns Hopkins University, where he remained for sixteen years, always 
developing better ways of training medical students.Finally in 1905 he was appointed Regius Professor 
of medicine at Oxford University in England.From his class rooms a steady stream of medical teachers 
went forth to many distant parts of the world.Osler was a genius in his uncanny skill at making an 
accurate diagnosis from what often seemed rather slim evidence.He was rarely wrong, and proved his diagnosis 
by post-morterm examinations.Osler was an authority on diseases of the blood.He encouraged students 
in the use of the microscope and every other means for the accurate diagnosis of disease.
Osler was well known for his clear grasp of infectious diseases affecting the heart, and also angina pectoris 
and malaria and other diseases affecting the circulation.He was admired and loved by students and parents alike.
His influence is still felt in medical circles today, not only for his scientific work but also for the spirit 
he imparted to all who came under the spell of his genius.
