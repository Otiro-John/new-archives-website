<h1>Edward Jenner</h1>
<h2>Conquerer of Smallpox &<br>Develops Vaccination</h2>
<p>Toady it is almost impossible for us to fully realize what a vast difference the simplest act of vaccination has made in the 
world <strong>today</strong>.Let us in immagination step back two hundred years, to a period of frightfull epidemics, the worst of 
 which was smallpox.Every year thousands of people were being swept off to untimely graves in every country of the world.Doctors 
 were powerless.They had no means of combating this dread disease, smallpox.But among the country of  certain distics in England there 
 was the hint of a belief that if a person contracted cowpox, he might escape the ravages of smallpox.Learned people scoffed 
 at the idea, for they still did not associate the germs discoverd by Leeuwenhoek with the diseases that destroyed so many 
 lives.Into one of the districts came a physician.Edward Jenner.No one realized it then,but this young man was destined to 
 become one of the most famous men of his age.It was somewhere around 1776 that young Dr. Jenner began to wonder 
 what could be done about smallpox.For years He observed the disease, compairing it with cowpox, until He was sure in himself 
 that the cowpox disease was a mider form of smallpox.He had no elaborate equipment , only his own clinical judgement, but He was 
 convinced these frughtful epidemics could be stopped.At the risk of losing his professional carreer, Jenner inoculated an eight 
 year old boy with material from the sores of cowpox on the hands of a milkmaid.The boy developed cowpox.The next year and 
 the one following, Jenner deliberately inoculated him with material from patients suffering from smallpox, but the boy never did 
developed the disease.In 1798 Jenner announced his great discovery to the world.Soon his methods of vaccination were adopted 
in other lands, with the result that smallpox epidemics grew less and less until they finally disappeared.The effectiveness 
of vaccination eas not so readily recognized in Endgland, but in France and other countries people were grateful for the wonderful 
discovery.On one occscion during the Napoleonic wars a number of English prisoners were being held in France even after peace was 
declared.Napoleon had rejected their plea to be returned to their homeland, when his wife , the Empress Josphine, quitely mentioned 
the name of Jenner.The Empress paused for a moment, then said,'Ah yes, Jenner, we can refuse nothing to that name.'The men were 
freed, thanks to Jenner who had conquered the dreadfull scourge of smallpox.His methods of vaccination opened the way for the 
conquest of polio,tetanus and many other scourges of the human race.
