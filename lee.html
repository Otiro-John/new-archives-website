<h1>Anthony van <br> Leeuwenhoek</h1>
<h2>Discoverer of Germs, Develops the Microscope</h2>
<p>Nearly three centuries have passed since Leeuwenhoek, of Holland first gazed upon a mysterious
new world of tiny microbes that no one had ever seen before.Many of these germs were friendly, others
were among the worst enemies of the human race.Not even in the wildest dreams did Leeuwenhoek imagine the importance
of the wornderful world of germs he had just discovered.Humanity had to wait two hundred years until
the days of Pasteur before the full meaning of this strange new world of germs could be fully
realized.Millions of people were still to die from diseases that might have been prevented had the full 
importance of Leeuwenhoek's discoveries been recognized.Scientists of those days were busy with other 
matters in the realm of chemistry,physics and astronomy before they turned their attention to finding
the causes of the world's most devastating diseases.Leeuwenhoek was not a trained scientist.He 
ran a dry-goods store.But in his spare time he developed great skill in grinding tiny lenses by 
hand.It was tedious work, but he was highly successful.He was a man without any formal education,which was 
rather fortunate, for his ignorance of Latin saved him from foolish philosophies so prevalent 
at that time.He had to depend on his own observations, and in simple Dutch style he exploded 
some of the world's most cherished myths and theories.To Leeuwenhoek more than to any other man we 
probably owe the very beginnings of the microscope.This valuable instrunment has probably 
contributed more information than any other used in the study of the human body.Leeuwenhoek's 
microscopes were crude, often consisting of one carefully hand-ground lens.For suitable lighting 
he had to hold them up to the window.But His discoveries were astounding to men of science in those 
days.And from his humble beginning has come a vast amount of knowledge concerning the human 
body and the diseases to which it falls heir.
